</p><p>The objective of this project is to practice and assess your
understanding of functional programming and Haskell. You will write code to
implement a guessing game.</p><!--TOC section id="sec1" The Game of <span style="font-family:sans-serif">Cardguess</span> -->
<h2 id="sec1" class="section">The Game of <span style="font-family:sans-serif">Cardguess</span></h2><!--SEC END --><p><span style="font-family:sans-serif">Cardguess</span> is a two-player logical guessing game.
Two players face each other, each with a
complete standard deck of western playing cards (without jokers). One player
will be the <em>answerer</em> and the other is the <em>guesser</em>. The
answerer begins by selecting some number of cards from his or her deck without
showing the guesser. These cards will form the <em>answer</em> for this
game. The aim of the game is for the guesser to guess the answer.</p><p>Once the answerer has selected the answer, the guesser chooses the
same number of
cards from his or her deck to form the <em>guess</em>
and shows them to the
answerer. The answerer responds by telling the guesser these five
numbers as <em>feedback</em> for the guess:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
How many of the cards in the answer are also in the guess
(<em>correct cards</em>).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">How many cards in the answer have rank lower than
the lowest rank in the guess (<em>lower ranks</em>). Ranks,
in order from low to high, are 2&#X2013;10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">How many of the cards in the answer have the same rank as a card
in the guess (<em>correct ranks</em>). For this, each card in the guess is
only counted once. That is, if the answer has two queens and the
guess has one, the correct ranks number would be 1, not 2. Likewise
if there is one queen in the answer and two in the clue.
</li><li class="li-enumerate">How many cards in the answer have rank higher than
the highest rank in the guess (<em>higher ranks</em>).
</li><li class="li-enumerate">How many of the cards in the answer have the same suit as a card
in the guess, only counting a card in the guess once
(<em>correct suits</em>). For example, if the answer has two clubs and the guess has
one club, or vice versa, the correct suits number would be 1, not 2.
</li></ol><p>
Note that the order of the cards in the answer and the guess is
immaterial, and that, since they come from a single deck, cards cannot
be repeated in either answer or guess.</p><p>The guesser then guesses again, and receives feedback for the new
guess, repeating the process until the guesser guesses the answer
correctly. The object of the game for the
guesser is to guess the answer with the fewest possible guesses.</p><p>A few examples of the feedback for a given answer and guess:

<h2 id="sec2" class="section">The Program</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
You will write Haskell code to implement the <em>guesser</em> part of
the game. This will require you to write a function to return your
initial guess, and another to use the feedback from the previous guess
to determine the next guess. The latter function will be called
repeatedly until it produces the correct guess. You will find it
useful to keep information between guesses; since Haskell is a purely
functional language, you cannot use a global or static variable to
store this. Therefore, your initial guess function must return this
game state information, and your next guess function must take the
game state as input and return the updated game state as output. You
may put any information you like in the game state, but you
<span style="font-style:italic">must</span> define a type <span style="font-family:monospace">GameState</span> to hold this
information.</p><p>I will supply a <span style="font-family:monospace">Card</span> module providing the <span style="font-family:monospace">Card</span>,
<span style="font-family:monospace">Rank</span>, and <span style="font-family:monospace">Suit</span> types and their constructors. This
implementation has a few enhancements from the types presented in
lectures. First, all three types are in the <span style="font-family:monospace">Eq</span> class. All
are also in the <span style="font-family:monospace">Bounded</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">Enum</span> class, which means,
for example, that <span style="font-family:monospace">[minBound..maxBound]::[Card]</span> is the list of
all cards in order, from 2&#X2663;to A&#X2660;, and similarly 
<span style="font-family:monospace">[minBound..maxBound]::[Rank]</span> is the list of ranks from 2 to
Ace, and similarly for <span style="font-family:monospace">Suit</span>. This also means that, for
example, <span style="font-family:monospace">succ (Card Club R5) == (Card Club R6)</span> and
<span style="font-family:monospace">succ (Card Heart Ace) == (Card Spade R2)</span>.
Read the documentation for
<span style="font-family:monospace">Bounded</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">Enum</span> classes for more things you can do
with them.</p><p>The <span style="font-family:monospace">Rank</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">Suit</span> types are also in the <span style="font-family:monospace">Ord</span>
class, so for example <span style="font-family:monospace">Ace &gt; King</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">Heart &lt; Spade</span>.
For convenience, all three types are also in the <span style="font-family:monospace">Show</span> class
so that ranks and suits are shown as a single
character (10 is shown as <span style="font-family:monospace">T</span>), and cards as two characters:
rank followed by suit. All three are also in the Read class, which
means that, for example, <span style="font-family:monospace">(read "[2C,AH]")::[Card]</span> returns the
list <span style="font-family:monospace">[Card Club R2, Card Heart Ace]</span> (which would be printed
as <span style="font-family:monospace">[2C,AH]</span>).</p><p>You must define following two functions, as well as the
<span style="font-family:monospace">GameState</span> type:
</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">initialGuess :: Int </span>&#X2192;<span style="font-weight:bold"> ([Card],GameState)</span></dt><dd class="dd-description">  <br>
 takes the number of cards in the answer as input and returns a
pair of an initial guess, which should be a list of the specified
number of cards, and a game state. The number of cards
specified will be 2 for most of the test, and 3 or 4 for the
remaining tests, as explained below.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">nextGuess :: ([Card],GameState) </span>&#X2192;<span style="font-weight:bold"> (Int,Int,Int,Int,Int)
</span>&#X2192;<span style="font-weight:bold"> ([Card],GameState)</span></dt><dd class="dd-description">  <br>
 takes as input a pair of the previous guess and game state, and
the feedback to this guess as a quintuple of counts of correct
cards, low ranks, correct ranks, high ranks, and correct suits,
and returns a pair of the next guess and new game state.
</dd></dl><p>You must call your (main) source file <span style="font-family:monospace">Cardguess.hs</span> or
<span style="font-family:monospace">Cardguess.lhs</span>, and it must contain the module declaration:
</p><pre class="verbatim">    module Cardguess (initialGuess, nextGuess, GameState) where
</pre><p>You may divide your code into as many files as you like, as long as
your main file (and the files it imports) imports all the others. But
do not feel you need to divide your program into many files if it is
reasonably small.</p><p>I will also provide a test driver program called
<span style="font-family:monospace">Cardguesstest.hs</span> to allow you to conveniently test your
<span style="font-family:monospace">Cardguess</span> implementation. You can specify the cards of
the answer on the command line, and the program will print out each
guess and the corresponding feedback and report the number of guesses
needed to find the answer. The <span style="font-family:monospace">Cardguesstest.hs</span> is
substantially similar to the test
driver I will use for testing your code. You can compile
and link your code for testing using the command:
</p><pre class="verbatim">    ghc -O2 --make Cardguesstest
</pre><p>I will use a similar command to compile your code in preparation for
testing.</p><!--TOC section id="sec3" Assessment-->
<h2 id="sec3" class="section">Assessment</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Your project will be assessed on the following criteria:
</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description"> 
<span style="font-weight:bold">30%</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Quality of your code and documentation;
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">30%</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Correctness of your implementation;
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">30%</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Quality of the guesses made by your implementation, as
indicated by the number of guesses needed to find 2-card targets;
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">10%</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> Correctness and quality of your guesses for 3- and 4-card targets.
</dd></dl><p>
The supplied
<span style="font-family:monospace">Cardguesstest</span> implementation will use the number of cards
specified on the command line to determine the number to specify to
the <span style="font-family:monospace">initialGuess</span> function.</p><p>Note that timeouts will be imposed on all tests. You will have at least 10
seconds to guess each answer, regardless of how many guesses are needed.
Executions taking longer than that may be unceremoniously terminated,
leading to that test being assessed as failing. Your programs will be
compiled with <span style="font-family:monospace">ghc -O2</span> (optimisation enabled) before testing, so
10 seconds per test 
is a very reasonable limit. The same 10 second timeout will apply to
the bonus mark test cases.</p><p>See the Project Coding Guidelines on the LMS for detailed recommendations
for coding style. These guidelines will form the basis of the
quality assessment of your code and documentation, which is worth 30%
of the project mark, so read them carefully.</p><!--TOC section id="sec4" Submission-->
<h2 id="sec4" class="section">Submission</h2><!--SEC END --><p>The project submission deadline is 5 September 2014 at 5pm.</p><p>You must submit your project from one of the unix servers <span style="font-family:monospace">nutmeg.eng.unimelb.edu.au</span> or 
<span style="font-family:monospace">dimefox.eng.unimelb.edu.au</span>.
Make sure the version of your program source files
you wish to submit is on this host, and then <span style="font-family:monospace">cd</span> to the directory
holding your source code and issue the command:
</p><pre>
    submit COMP90048 proj1 Cardguess.hs
</pre><p>
If your code spans multiple source files, add the extra ones to the
end of that command line.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Important:</span> you must wait a few minutes
after submitting, and then issue the command
</p><pre>
    verify COMP90048 proj1 | less
</pre><p>
This
will show you the test results from your submission, as well as the
file(s) you submitted.
If your program
compiles and runs properly, you should see the line &#X201C;<span style="font-family:monospace">Running
tests</span>&#X201D;, followed by forty test runs, each showing the number of guesses
your program took. If you do not see test runs like this, then your
program did not work correctly.
If the test results show any problems, correct
them and submit again. You may submit as often as you like; only your
final submission will be assessed.</p><p>If you wish to (re-)submit after the project deadline, you may do so
by adding &#X201C;<span style="font-family:monospace">.late</span>&#X201D; to the end of the project name
(<em>i.e.,</em> <span style="font-family:monospace">proj1.late</span>) in the <span style="font-family:monospace">submit</span> and
<span style="font-family:monospace">verify</span> commands. But note that a penalty, described below,
will apply to late submissions, so you should weigh the points you
will lose for a late submission against the points you expect to gain
by revising your program and submitting again.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">It is your responsibility to verify your submission.</span></p><p>Windows users should see the LMS Resources list for instructions for

<h3 id="sec5" class="subsection">Late Penalties</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
Late submissions will incur a penalty of 0.5% of the possible value of that
submission per hour 
late, including evening and weekend hours.
Late submissions will incur a penalty of 0.5% per hour late,
including evening and weekend hours. This means that a perfect
project that is much more than 4 days late will receive less than half
the marks for the project. If you have a
medical or similar compelling reason for being late, you should contact 
the lecturer
as early as possible to ask for an extension
(preferably before the due date).</p><!--TOC section id="sec6" Hints-->
<h2 id="sec6" class="section">Hints</h2><!--SEC END --><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
A very simple approach to this program is to simply guess every
possible combination of different cards until you guess right.
There are only 52&#XD7;51/2 = 1326 possible answers, so on average
it should only take about 663 guesses, making it perfectly feasible
to do in 10 seconds. However, this will give a very poor score for
guess quality.</li><li class="li-enumerate">A better approach would be to only make guesses that are
consistent with the answers you have received for previous guesses.
You can do this by computing the list of possible answers, and
removing elements that are inconsistent with any answers you have
received to previous guesses. A possible answer is inconsistent
with an answer you have received for a previous guess if the answer
you would receive for that guess and that (possible) answer is
different from the answer you actually received for that guess. For
two-card answers, the initial list of possible guesses is only 1326
elements, and rapidly shrinks with feedback, so this is quite
feasible. This scales up to about 5 cards, when the initial number
of possible guesses is 2,598,960. Beyond that, another strategy
would need to be used, but you only need to handle 2 cards, and only
up to 4 for bonus marks.<p>You can use your <span style="font-family:monospace">GameState</span> type to store the list of
remaining possible answers, and pare it down each time you receive
feedback for a guess.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate">The best results can be had by carefully choosing a guess that
is likely to leave you the smallest remaining list of possible
answers. You can do this by computing, for each remaining possible
answer, the average number of possible answers it will leave if you
guess it.
Given a candidate guess G (which should be selected from the
remaining possible answers), compute
the feedback you will receive for each possible answer A if G is the
guess and A is the answer. If you group all the As by the feedback
they give you, your aim is to have many small groups, because that
means if you make G your guess, that will probably leave few possible
answers when you receive the feedback. Therefore the expected
number of remaining possible answers for that guess is the average
of the sizes of these groups, weighted by the sizes of the groups.
That is, it is the sum of the squares of the group sizes divided by
the sum of the group sizes.</li><li class="li-enumerate">For the first guess, when the list of possible answers is at its
longest, you may want to use a different approach. Given the way
the feedback works, the best first guess would be to choose two
cards of different suits and with ranks about equally distant
from each other and from the top and bottom ranks. In general, for
an <span style="font-style:italic">n</span> card answer, you should choose ranks that are about
13/(<span style="font-style:italic">n</span>+1) ranks apart.</li><li class="li-enumerate">Note that these are just hints; you are welcome to use any
approach you like to solve this, as long as it is correct and runs
within the allowed time.</li><li class="li-enumerate">For a two card answer, with a good guessing strategy such as
outlined above, 4 or 5 guesses is usually enough to guess it.
Surprisingly, adding more cards does not increase the number of
guesses needed very much.
